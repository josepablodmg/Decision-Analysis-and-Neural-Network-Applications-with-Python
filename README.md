# ðŸš€ Final Project: Decision Analysis & Neural Networks

## Description
A cutting-edge project merging business strategy and advanced AI. I analyzed a multi-national fintechâ€™s decision-making using SMART analysis, value trees, and Monte Carlo simulations, then built and fine-tuned neural networks for predicting Titanic survival and recognizing handwritten digits in MNIST. This project highlights optimization, machine learning, and data-driven decision-makingâ€”all in one portfolio-ready showcase.

## Repository Structure
- `Task1_DecisionAnalysis/` - Evaluate strategic options for fintech support using value trees, probability modeling, and Monte Carlo simulations.
- `Task2_TitanicNN/` - Fine-tune neural networks on Titanic data, experiment with architectures, input features, and batch training for optimal predictive performance.
- `Task3_MNIST/` - Implement backpropagation on MNIST, optimize hidden layers and learning rates, and achieve high-accuracy handwritten digit recognition.
- `README.md` - Overview, instructions, and highlights.

## How to Run
1. Install required packages: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`.
2. Open notebooks in Jupyter or VS Code.
3. Follow step-by-step instructions to reproduce analyses, simulations, and neural network experiments.
