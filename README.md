# Decision-Analysis-and-Neural-Network-Applications-with-Python
This project applies decision analysis and machine learning to solve business and predictive problems. It evaluates fintech strategies using value and probability trees, fine-tunes neural networks for the Titanic dataset, and uses backpropagation to recognize MNIST digits, focusing on optimization and performance.
